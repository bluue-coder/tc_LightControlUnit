# tc_LightControlUnit
This repository contains an easy set of TwinCAT projects.
All files were written and ran under Beckhoff supervision.

There is a PLC project, an HMI project and a framework feeding the HMI.
These are all based on the example of a Lightswitch or a Light-Controller.

Most features are based on variables.
In this example there are 8 lamps, 4 of which dimmable and the others not.

The original task (in German) is also in this repository.

To run this code:
Clone the entire repository to a new folder and import the *.sln file to VisualStudio after integrating TwinCAT and TwinCAT HMI.
Then open and run LightControlUnit.sln in VisualStudio.
To view the GUI live:
Open HMI_LightControlUnit/Desktop.view and right-click the file in the Solution Explorer.
Choose Show in Live-View...

Happy Coding!
