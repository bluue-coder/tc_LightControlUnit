# tc_LightControlUnit
This repository contains an easy set of TwinCat projects.
All files were written and ran under BEckhoff supervision.

There is a PLC project, an HMI project and a framework feeding the HMI.
These are all based on the example of a Lightswitch or a Light-Controller.

Most features are based on variables.
In this example there are 8 lamps, 4 of which dimmable and the others not.

The original task (in German) is also in this repository.
